## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Oh man, where to start. 

1. How to build mobile first using media queries

2. How to get CSS Grid to work and be responsive, even if it meant rewriting everything. S/O to Kevin Powell on Youtube [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t) and this article saved my life [](https://travishorn.com/responsive-grid-in-2-minutes-with-css-grid-layout-4842a41420fe)

3. Kevin Powell also showed me how to initialize variables in CSS for efficiency when working from a given design

4. How to create a mobile hamburger menu from scratch. S/O Web Sev Simplified on Youtube [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg)

5. How to dim the background when you click the mobile menu [](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60228488/mobile-menu-css-div-dim-visible-background-around-menu)

6. How to make my own icons through the use of empty spans (hamburger menu) and skewX/skewY on letters or symbols (+ used for X on menu)

7. How to manage visibility through the use of z-index. I pieced this together from the dimmer article and random Stack Overflow posts

8. How to make margin and padding responsive through the use of % instead of px. This one hit hard. 


### Continued development

Through this process, I realized how much you can do with just CSS. I want to continue to build sites mobile first with media queries for responsiveness. I want to keep building with CSS Grid. And I want to continue building custom widgets for my sites and continue to never copy/paste into my code. Even if it's hard, it teaches me something.
